      <h2>About Kat</h2>
      <p>Kat is the ultimate cat lady you've always dreamed you could
      be. Never has a Halloween gone by where her twelve cats weren't
      all dressed to impress. Five years ago, she decided to open
      Kat's Costume Shop to share her passion with the world.
      </p>
